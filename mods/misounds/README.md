# MI Sounds
This mod makes Monster Infrequents make sound when dropped on the ground
The sound plays even if item is dropped from the inventory
The sound plays on impact with the ground - so you can't miss your MI. If you heard the
sound but can't pick an item up - just wait for it to stop rolling on the ground
