# Working folder for Art Manager tool
Here is where the sources for the build will be taken  
This folder contains dbr/item/object/boss template files which  
are necessary to generate actual game objects.  

This folder will be used when building your mod combinations: the actual mod files will be merged into a new folder here  
and passed onto the Art Manager to build.
