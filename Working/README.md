# Working folder for Art Manager tool
Here is where the sources for the build will be taken  
This folder contains dbr/item/object/boss template files which  
are necessary to generate actual game objects.  

This folder will be used when building your mod combinations: the actual mod files will be merged into a new folder here  
and passed onto the Art Manager to build.  

The templates here are currently for 2.10.21415 version of the game.  
If you want to make changes using different version you will have to generate templates for that version
